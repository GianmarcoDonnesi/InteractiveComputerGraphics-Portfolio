# Interactive Computer Graphics Portfolio

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of projects developed throughout the Interactive Computer Graphics course a.y. 23/24. Each project is a testament to the learning journey undertaken in this course, demonstrating the application of theoretical concepts in practical scenarios. This series of homework projects were inspired by the [CS 4660 course](https://graphics.cs.utah.edu/courses/cs4600/fall2023/) of the University of Utah.


## Course Overview

The Interactive Computer Graphics course has offered an in-depth study of computer graphics fundamentals, including topics such as 3D rendering, animation, and how users interact with digital environments. It has explored numerous essential topics such as geometric transformations, models of lighting and shading, texture mapping, graphics hardware, and the seamless fusion of WebGL with HTML5 and JavaScript.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `/Project1_ComposingImages`: this folder contains the first project, which focuses on implementing an alpha compositing function for raster images using JavaScript.
- `/Project2_Transformations`: this folder contains the second project, which focuses on implementing a UAV simulation design using transformation functions in JavaScript.
- `/Project3_TriangularMeshes`: this folder contains the third project, which focuses on implementing a WebGL-based application dedicated to the 3D rendering of triangular meshes.



Each project folder includes:
- Source code files
- Detailed README file explaining the project objectives, techniques used, and how to run the application
- Any necessary assets (textures, models, etc.)


## Technologies Used

Throughout these projects, we have used various graphics programming libraries and tools, like:

- WebGL
- Three.js
- JavaScript
